        <h2>All about Pukhet</h2>
        
        <p>Phuket[a] is one of the southern provinces (changwat) of Thailand. It consists of the island of Phuket, the country's largest island, and another 32 smaller islands off its coast.[6] It lies off the west coast of mainland Thailand in the Andaman Sea. Phuket Island is connected by the Sarasin Bridge to Phang Nga province to the north. The next nearest province is Krabi, to the east across Phang Nga Bay.</p>

        <p>Phuket province, encompassing an area of 576 km2 (222 sq mi), ranks as the second-smallest province in Thailand. Its size is comparable to, albeit slightly smaller than, that of Singapore. Historically, Phuket Island was situated on a major trading route between India and China. This strategic location led to its frequent mention in the logs of foreign ships, including those from Portugal, France, the Netherlands, and England. Despite this attention from various European powers, Phuket was never colonized by any European nation.</p>

        <p>Economically, the province's wealth was initially derived from tin and rubber production. In more recent times, Phuket has transitioned to tourism as its primary source of income. More than 100,000 foreigners are estimated to have settled in Phuket.[7]</p>
